Iâ€™m a CS transfer student at the University of Michigan with a passion for combining math, code, and curiosity to solve real world problems. Iâ€™ve tutored students in calculus, statistics, and algebra, led my college's Math and Physics Club, and developed award-winning projects in AIâ€”like an MRI tumor detection program using PyTorch. Iâ€™m constantly learning and building, with recent focuses on PyTorch, computer vision, and data visualization.
