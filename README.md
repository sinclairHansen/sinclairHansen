I'm currently a sophomore at Schoolcraft College with a plan to get a bachelors in computer science. I am really interested in studying
ML/AI and have goals of learning more about computer vision and LLMs. My goals for this school year is to build my first 
AI vision project, learn SQL, and build upon my data science skills. Wish me luck!
